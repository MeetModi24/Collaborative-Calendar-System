# Collaborative Calendar for Event Scheduling

## Project Overview

The **Event Management System** is a collaborative calendar platform designed to streamline group scheduling, event coordination, and participant interaction. It supports real-time updates, role-based access control, notification handling, and client-side caching to ensure high performance and consistency.

This project enables users to:
- Create and manage groups with distinct roles (Admin, Editor, Viewer)
- Schedule events collaboratively
- Handle invitations and notifications
- Optimize performance through local caching
- Prevent conflicts via version-controlled concurrency mechanisms
